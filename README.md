## Presentation
When I was younger, I saw this watch from "haut horloger" Pierre Kunz.

The watch was named *Infinity looping*, or sometimes *Insanity*. 

Concept is relatively simple; basically a spirograph. Two connected gears, with an hour hand on the smallest of them, over an epitrochoid ribbon with regular markings.

The watch is gorgeous, and if you can afford to spend between $8k-$20k, I'd definitely recommend it. I personally can't.

But I do own an Android Smartwatch! And it comes with the ability to use a custom "Watch face" to display passing time. I decided to build on Insanity's concept, and come up with my own unique take on it---since it's displayed on screen, it's easy to change some of the inner machinery or add more information to the watch.
